  <p>There’s no secret to step-by-step formula for writing the perfect About page, but there are essential elements that will guide you as you breathe life into your story and your work. The style, tone, language and design should all be unique to you. What rings true for you and your audience probably won’t be the same as what floats other another bloggers’ boat. Aim for authenticity, always. Before you start crafting, take some time to ponder these questions:
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>#1. How do you want people to feel when they read your words?</b></h3>

Like a rocket has been lit underneath them. Soaked in love. Held. Supported. Inspired. Informed. Empowered. Connected. Soothed. Intrigued.

Whip up with a list of your own guiding words before you sit down for the business of writing, and make a point to check back in throughout the process. Does your original intention match what’s unfolding? Have you veered off course?
<br><br>
<h3><b>#2. How can you be different?</b></h3>

In the vast ocean that is the blogosphere, how can you stand out? 
<br>
Where can you inject a little magic that’s yours and yours alone? 
<br>How can you be innovative and memorable? 
<br>Incite curiosity? 
<br>Leave your reader thinking? 
<br>Perhaps, even, rile them up a little if it’s aligned with your message?
<br><br>
<h3><b>#3. What speaks to YOU? (or: Research Time)</b></h3>

Can you think of an About page that reeled you in from the get go? 
<br>What was it about the page that resonated with you? The tone? The words? The story? 
<br>The length? Additional elements (images, video, design?)
<br>
Take yourself on a journey of inspiration around the web and find five About pages that leave a lasting imprint on you, and break down exactly why they speak your language.
<br>
Dig deeper into what is that turns you on, and – this is key! – visualise yourself having the same impact on your ‘right people,’ because when you infuse your page with you and come from a place of service and good intent, you will.
